CREATING A GITHUB ACCOUNT AND ADDING A REPOSITORY:

Follow the link: https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/
 
USING GIT ON UBUNTU INSTANCE:

1.  	Install git using apt-get install git.
2.  	Set the configuration details of a github user as:
          git config --global user.name “radius”
          git config --global user.email “anjalijain5094@gmail.com”
          
INTEGRATING UBUNTU INSTANCE WITH GITHUB:

1.  	We will access the github repositories from Ubuntu using ssh. For that we need to generate ssh keys in the machine.
          ssh-keygen –t rsa –C “anjalijain5094@gmail.com”
          (associating the email id with key generation helps to identify the keys later on)
2.  	Enter the default path for key pair: /root/.ssh/id_rsa
3.  	Enter the pass-phrase: radius@server
4.  	After executing, 2 keys will be generated in /root/.ssh: id_rsa and id_rsa.pub. We need to copy this public key on the 
        github account.
5.  	Open your account and click on Your Profile-->SSH and GPG key-->New SSH key-->paste the public key and give a title
        radius@server->Add the key.

PULLING THE REPOSITORY FROM GITHUB TO UBUNTU:

1.  	Now we can clone any repository on our Ubuntu machine, in our case it is ‘hello-world’ repository. To clone it, we need
        the URL of the repository. So, click on the repository name in the github. Open “Clone or Download option” and click 
		on “SSH”. Then copy the “URL(git@github.com:AnjaliJain1993/hello-world.git)”.
2.  	Now on the Ubuntu terminal, enter any directory (/etc) and execute the following command: 
		  git clone git@github.com:AnjaliJain1993/hello-world.git
3.  	Enter the passphrase: radius@server
4.  	Now a clone of the said repository will be created in the /etc directory (/etc/hello-world).

PUSHING THE REPOSITORY FROM UBUNTU TO GITHUB :

1.  	Create a new repository in the /etc directory: git init Mytest. A Mytest folder will be created and init makes 
        the directory a github repository. Change the current directory to this newly created directory: cd Mytest
2.  	Create a README file using vi README and add some contents.
3.  	Create another file ‘sample.c’ using vi sample.c and add some code.
4.  	Now we need to add the files to an index which is a buffer to store the files/folders that have to be added in the 
			github repository.
			git add README
			git add sample.c
5.  	Commit changes made to the index:
			git commit –m “some message”
6.  	Create a repository in github with the same name as the local “Mytest” repository and run the command in Ubuntu terminal:
			git remote add origin git@github.com:AnjaliJain1993@Mytest.git
7.  	Push files in local repository to github repository:
			git push origin master
        Enter passphrase: radius@server
8.  	The entire repository has been copied to the github repository.

UPLOADING FILES FROM A SPECIFIC DIRECTORY(FREERADIUS) TO GITHUB:

1.  	Create a new repository in github “Freeradius”. We will upload all the files and folders of freeradius directory to 
        this repository.
2.  	For that we need to initialize the freeradius directory as a git repository.
			cd /etc/freeradius
			/etc/freeradius/git init
3.  	Add the files in your new local repository using : git add .
4.  	Commit the files that you've staged in your local repository using :
			git commit -m "First commit".
5.  	Add the URL of the remote repository where your local repository will be pushed using :
			git remote add origin git@github.com:AnjaliJain1993@Freeradius.git
6.  	Verify the new remote URL using : git remote –v .
7.  	Push files in local repository to github repository using : git push origin master .
8.  	Check Freeradius repository in github.

PULLING A SINGLE FILE OR A FOLDER FROM GITHUB:

1.  	Install subversion in Ubuntu using apt-get install subversion .
2.  	To download entire repository:
			svn checkout https://github.com/AnjaliJain1993/Freeradius.git
 
			(Open “clone and download option” and copy the URL of https)
3.  	To download a specific file:
			svn export https://github.com/AnjaliJain1993/Freeradius.git/trunk/allow.php
4.	To forcefully overwrite the file:
			svn export https://github.com/AnjaliJain1993/Freeradius.git/trunk/allow.php --force)
5. 	To download a specific folder:
	    svn export https://github.com/rachit-m/radius-authentication.git/branches/freeradius/certs
	    (freeradius is a branch)

PULLING A PARTICULAR BRANCH OF THE REMOTE REPOSITORY FROM GITHUB TO LOCAL MACHINE :($BRANCH SHOULD BE REPLACED WITH YOUR 
REMOTE BRANCH):

1.     mkdir $BRANCH
2.     cd $BRANCH
3.     git init
4.     git remote add -t $BRANCH -f origin $REMOTE_REPO
5.     git checkout $BRANCH            ($BRANCH is set up to track remote branch from origin using checkout)
6.     git pull origin $BRANCH         (To sync the local branch with remote branch )
